#  Udacity VRPuzzler Project

This project is done as part of the Udacity VR Developer Nanodegree program.

For this project we are required to design a simple mobile game/app, having the user experience in mind. To achieve this goal, we will conduct user testing to get feedback frequently, so that changes are easier to make in early stages of development. It is important to note that we take ergonomics, aural and visual stimuli into account to implement an intuitive and easy to play game.

The goal of this project was to teach me fundamentals in design and user centered thinking in VR and motion in VR.

In this the player will click start button and will enter dungeon and must solve the puzzle in order to exit the room.This VR project will be used by the Puzzle Solver or VR Geeks to have better experience of VR to solve a puzzle.
